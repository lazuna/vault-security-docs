    title: "Security by Design"
    description: >
      Foundational philosophy for engineering systems that secure themselves — 
      not through reactive patchwork, but through intentional architecture, feedback loops, and trust boundaries.
      This design lens aims for resilient defaults, context-aware enforcement, and minimal blast radius.

  principles:
    - name: "Signal Fidelity > Volume"
      description: >
        High-fidelity telemetry enables faster triage and reduces fatigue.
        Design detection pipelines to prioritize precision over coverage.

    - name: "Identity as the Perimeter"
      description: >
        Treat identity, authentication, and authorization as the core enforcement surface —
        especially in cloud-native, API-driven, and ephemeral architectures.

    - name: "Context-Aware Enforcement"
      description: >
        Controls must adapt based on workload, risk profile, user behavior, and environment.
        Static policies age poorly — aim for policy engines that can reason dynamically.

    - name: "Built-in Observability"
      description: >
        Instrumentation should be embedded at design time —
        not bolted on post-deployment.
        Every decision and control point should be observable, traceable, and measurable.

    - name: "Principled Degradation"
      description: >
        Design for failure. Recovery, isolation, and fault containment must be first-class citizens.
        Assume breach, assume loss, and ensure graceful fallback.

    - name: "No Blind Trust"
      description: >
        Minimize implicit trust between services, users, and environments.
        Leverage attestation, verification, and conditional access.

  design_maxims:
    - "A breach is often a design flaw that passed audit."
    - "Every system is secure until someone asks it a new question."
    - "What you can't observe, you can't defend."
    - "The best control is the one that operates silently and correctly."

  use_cases:
    - architecture_review: "Embed in design checklists and security gates"
    - detection_engineering: "Anchor detection logic to control objectives and signal integrity"
    - threat_modeling: "Evaluate designs through abuse cases, failure modes, and misconfiguration paths"
    - onboarding: "Used to align new engineers and architects with vault principles"

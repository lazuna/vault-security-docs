  context:
    title: "Operational Philosophy"
    description: >
      Strategic foundation for designing, running, and evolving cybersecurity programs.
      This philosophy prioritizes clarity over chaos, automation over toil, and outcomes over appearances —
      all while embedding learning systems and silent defense as core tenets.

  themes:
    - title: "Quiet Wins"
      principle: >
        Mature security systems reduce the noise floor — fewer false positives, calmer escalations, and faster recoveries.
        Silence is a signal of alignment between engineering and risk.

    - title: "Signal > Noise"
      principle: >
        Every alert, metric, and policy must be tied to a threat model or business-critical behavior.
        Eliminate vanity telemetry. Prioritize signal compression, not signal amplification.

    - title: "Predictability"
      principle: >
        Resilience is rooted in predictability. Systems should degrade gracefully, fail fast, and recover autonomously.

  priorities:
    - "Policies that reduce toil — embed compliance into defaults and CI/CD flows"
    - "Threat intelligence integrated as feedback loops into detection and response tuning"
    - "Adaptive systems — infrastructure and controls that learn from incidents and evolve"
    - "Knowledge centralization — architecture, incidents, and decisions captured as living documentation"
    - "Architect for absence — operate as if no one is watching, and it still works"

  use_cases:
    - roadmap_alignment: "Used to anchor annual security strategy and OKRs"
    - onboarding_compass: "Shared with new team members to convey foundational principles"
    - architecture_review: "Evaluated against during threat modeling and design reviews"
